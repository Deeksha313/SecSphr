# Bug Fix Summary: UndefinedError Resolution

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
**Error:** `jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'outer_loop' is undefined`

**Root Cause:** In the questionnaire template (`fill_questionnaire_section.html`), I had incorrectly used `outer_loop.index0` when modifying the radio button implementation, but there was no variable named `outer_loop` in the template context.

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**
### **Template Fix:**
1. **Identified the problem:** The template had nested loops (questions → options) but I was referencing a non-existent `outer_loop` variable.

2. **Solution implemented:**
   ```jinja2
   {% for question in questions %}
       {% set question_idx = loop.index0 %}  <!-- Store question index -->
       {% for option in question.options %}
           <input ... name="answer_{{ question_idx }}" 
                      id="answer_{{ question_idx }}_{{ loop.index0 }}" ... >
       {% endfor %}
   {% endfor %}
   ```

3. **Fixed all affected fields:**
   - Radio button inputs (`name="answer_{{ question_idx }}"`)
   - Radio button IDs (`id="answer_{{ question_idx }}_{{ loop.index0 }}"`)
   - Label `for` attributes
   - Textarea fields (`name="comment_{{ question_idx }}"`)
   - File upload fields (`name="evidence_{{ question_idx }}"`)
   - Data attributes for JavaScript
